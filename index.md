## About [Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfoadi/)

I am a software developer and a software architect based in Vancouver, BC focusing mainly on Android development. I graduated from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in 2006 with a BSc in Computing Sciences and started my adventurous career in Software Development. 

## My Story
Software development isn't just what I do; it's what I love. Although I have been doing Android development since early 2010, I've dipped my toes in a healthy number of platforms and languages over the course of my career. 

### Programming Languages
As mentioned, I've used a number of languages during my software development career. The more memorable ones are listed below.

#### C++
During my time at Electronics Arts Canada, the majority of the projects that I worked on were written in C++. As such, I spent most of my time writing tests for and debugging C++. C++ was also the first (real<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>) programming language that I used and as such, it holds a special place in my heart.

#### C#/.Net
While C++ is a powerful language that can accomplish a lot, it lacks a bit in terms of GUI development. As the list of my projects expanded to include some build configurtion tools at EA, I was exposed to C# and the .Net (2.0) Framework. C# has been a favorite of mine since as I never came across a task that was _difficult_ to do in C#. 

#### JAVA
Java, also known as the boilerplate language was a staple at universities during my education. While I find the language simple, I also find it very wordy. Thankfully, I started doing Android development with Java before having noticed the wordiness of Java ... it would have been a difficult time otherwise! Since Java 8 of course some of the boilerplate has been taken care of, turning Java into a beautiful language, too!

#### Kotlin
I had been hearing all the rave about [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/#_blank) for the past few months, but I hadn't find the time to actually play with it and boy have I missed out! With the [announcement](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html#_blank) that Kotlin has become and officially supported language for Android development, I had no excuses so I dove right in. While there are a few things missing <sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>, I've found Kotlin to be a beautiful and concise language.

#### Objective C
Obj-C is a backwards looking language. The name somewhat suggests it's a C-like language, but it feels like someone went far out of their way to have everything look as awkward and backwards as possible. Not even my own working code looked right to me when programming in Objective C.

#### Others
Aside from those mentioned above, I've also played around with PHP, Python, Assembly, C, Javascript, many flavors of BASIC, Haskell, and more.

### Android Development
I've been developing Android apps for most of my professional career. I became interested in Android in 2009 and started tinkering with AOSP in early 2010. I moved on to some simple apps as my time permitted, but It wasn't until early 2011 that I actually started working as Android developer.

### iOS Development
Although I found Objective-C to be a backwards looking language, I still made an effort to learn and use it. My official job description has never included iOS development, but as a Lead, I've had to dig in and help with the iOS development. This was when Swift was still very fresh and as such I haven't had any major exposure to Swift.

### UWP Development
The Universal Windows Platform seemed like an interesting idea and during the development of a private social networking app, I ran out of Android work. We were pondering the possibility of a desktop client as well as a Windows phone client and as a proof of concept, we decided to try UWP. I found the Windows Phone variant to have poor performance, but all testing was done on Windows Phone 10 beta releases. Either way, the PoC was a success and we had two clients running more or less the same codebase.

  <li><a name="fn1" />I did learn C64 BASIC, GW BASIC, and QBASIC, but they're all kind of ... well ... basic!</li>
  <li><a name="fn2" />This may very well be due to my lack of exposure to Kotlin. We'll see.</li>
